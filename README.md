# jbonsai

[日本語](https://github.com/jpreprocess/jbonsai/blob/main/README-ja.md)

Voice synthesis library for Text-to-Speech applications.

"jbonsai" converts sequence of full-context labels into audio waveform.

This project is currently a rewrite of [HTS Engine](https://hts-engine.sourceforge.net) in Rust language (This may change at any time, and there is no guarantee that jbonsai produces the same result as HTS Engine).

## Objectives

- Improve readability as much as possible.
- Without compromising readability,
  - Improve speed.
  - Keep memory consumption low.
- Can be compiled for WebAssembly.

## Usage

Put the following in `Cargo.toml`.

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```toml
[dependencies]
jbonsai = "0.2.2"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### SIMD (experimental)

jbonsai supports acceleration provided by feature [portable_simd](https://github.com/rust-lang/portable-simd). In order to enable SIMD acceleration,

- you must use nightly toolchain.
- you have to specify `features = ["simd"]` as follows:
  <!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  jbonsai = { version = "0.2.2", features = ["simd"] }
  ```
  <!-- x-release-please-end -->

The SIMD support is highly experimental and may change at any time.

## Example

This example produces a mono, 48,000 Hz (typically) PCM data saying 「盆栽」(ぼんさい; bonsai) in `speech` variable.

```rust
# fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
// 盆栽,名詞,一般,*,*,*,*,盆栽,ボンサイ,ボンサイ,0/4,C2
let lines = [
    "xx^xx-sil+b=o/A:xx+xx+xx/B:xx-xx_xx/C:xx_xx+xx/D:xx+xx_xx/E:xx_xx!xx_xx-xx/F:xx_xx#xx_xx@xx_xx|xx_xx/G:4_4%0_xx_xx/H:xx_xx/I:xx-xx@xx+xx&xx-xx|xx+xx/J:1_4/K:1+1-4",
